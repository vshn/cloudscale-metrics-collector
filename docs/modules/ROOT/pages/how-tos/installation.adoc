= Installation

== Requirements

This component requires https://github.com/appuio/component-appuio-cloud-reporting[component-appuio-cloud-reporting] and must be installed into the same
namespace. This is required for this component to be able to access the billing database and its connection secrets.

== Example

Since this is applied to the cluster globally, it has to go into the Commodore defaults repo (e.g. https://git.vshn.net/syn/commodore-defaults/).
